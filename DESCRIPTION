Description: The EpiSignalDetection package allows to explore time series for signal detection. 
    It is specifically designed to detect outbreaks for infectious disease surveillance data at EU/EEA or country level.
    The package includes:
    - An interactive Shiny application in which the user can import external data and perform basic signal detection analysis;
    - An automated report in HTML format, presenting the results of the time series analysis in tables and graphs 
    of signals detected at EU/EEA and country level. 
    This report can also be stratified by population characteristics (see 'Population' variable).
