# EpiSignalDetection
The "Epidemiological Signal Detection" R Package, designed by EpiConcept on behalf of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

# Description
The EpiSignalDetection package allows to explore time series for signal detection. It is specifically designed to detect outbreak for infectious disease surveillance data at EU/EEA or country level.

The package includes:

* __An interactive Shiny application__ (Fig.1) in which the user can import external data and perform basic signal detection analysis;
* __An automated report__ (Fig.2) in HTML format, presenting the results of the time series analysis in tables and graphs of signals detected at EU/EEA and country level. This report can also be stratified by population characteristics (see 'Population' variable).
